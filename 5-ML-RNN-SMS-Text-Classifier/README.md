# SMS Text Classifier using RNN

I tackled a common natural language processing task: sentiment analysis using recurrent neural networks (RNN) that classified SMS messages as either "ham" or "spam".
A "ham" message is a normal message sent by a friend. A "spam" message is an advertisement or a message sent by a company.
